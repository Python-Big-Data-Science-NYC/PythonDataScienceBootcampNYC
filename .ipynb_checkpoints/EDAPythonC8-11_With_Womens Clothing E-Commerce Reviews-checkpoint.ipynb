       " 'I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy',\n",
       " \"Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.\",\n",
       " 'I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.',\n",
       " \"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san\",\n",
       " 'I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.',\n",
       " 'This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!',\n",
       " \"I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!\",\n",
       " 'This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5\\'2\" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m 5\"0\" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.',\n",
       " 'Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!',\n",
       " 'After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i\\'m 5\\' 3\" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i\\'m wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.',\n",
       " 'I always look for things to hide \"parts\" without making my \"parts\" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn\\'t notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.',\n",
       " 'Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a \"box-like\" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.\\r\\nthe material isn\\'t what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light, somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.\\r\\ni am very happy with the color!',\n",
